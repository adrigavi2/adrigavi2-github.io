       and now her favorite quote...
       <br>
        "Women want to be loved like roses. They spend hours perfecting their eyebrows and toes and inventing irresistible curls that fall by accident down the back of their necks from otherwise austere hair-dos. They want their lover to remember the way they held a glass. They want to haunt." -Eve Babitz, Slow Days Fast Company
